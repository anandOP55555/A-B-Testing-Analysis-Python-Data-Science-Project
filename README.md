# A/B Testing Analysis — Python Data Science Project

This project performs a detailed **A/B Testing analysis** using Python to evaluate and compare the performance of two variants (A and B). It applies statistical hypothesis testing to determine if observed differences are significant.

## 📊 Overview
A/B testing is a powerful method for **data-driven decision making**, helping organizations test changes such as marketing campaigns, web designs, or product features.

This notebook includes:
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Conversion rate comparison  
- Hypothesis formulation and testing  
- P-value and confidence interval analysis  
- Statistical decision interpretation  

## 🧮 Key Steps
1. Load and explore dataset  
2. Calculate metrics (conversion rates, means, etc.)  
3. Define null and alternative hypotheses  
4. Perform statistical test (z-test or t-test)  
5. Interpret results and draw conclusions  

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Hypothesis Testing  
- Confidence Intervals  
- P-values  
- Statistical Significance  
- Decision Making under Uncertainty  

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  
- `scipy.stats`  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AB-Testing-Analysis.git


2. Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook Anand_Kumar_Yadav_ABTest.ipynb


Run all cells to reproduce the results.

📈 Results

The analysis determines whether the difference in performance between the control (A) and treatment (B) groups is statistically significant, guiding the decision to adopt or reject the new variant.

Would you like me to make a **short GitHub description (under 350 characters)** for this repo as well, like the one we did for the VaR project?
